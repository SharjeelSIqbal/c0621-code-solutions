  I. App.jsx
    1: App
      a. The class component App builds its constructor with one parameter props
         A. The construtor takes one parameter, props
         B. The super function is called with one argument, props
         C. An object literal is assigned to the state property of the this object
            with 3 properties the key user value null, the key isAuthorizing value true,
            the key route with the value of the return of the function parseRoute which is imported
            from ./lib/parse-route
            Aa. The parseRoute function is defined in the parse-route.js
                with one parameter.
            Ab. There's an if statement with the conditional that if
                the first index of hashRoute is '#' then hashRoute
                replaces '#' with '' and is reassigned with the new value
            Ac. The first and second index's are destructured from the return of the
                split method of the hashRoute object with one argument '?';
                and assigned to the constant variable in this order: path and queryString
            Ad. The URLSearchParams function is then called with the `new` operator
                with one argument queryString and assigned to params
            Ae. The function then returns an object literal with two properties
                the key path with the value path and the key params with the value params
          D. The bind method is called on the handleSignIn property of the `this` object
             with one argument, `this` and the return of method is assigned to the
             handleSignIn property of the this object
          C. The bind method is called on the handleSignOut property of the this object
             with one argument `this` and the return of the method is assigned to the
             handleSignOut property of the this object.
      b. Then the App class renders the page by calling the render function with no arguments
         A.
    2. ComponentDidMount
      a. ComponentDidMunt triggers and listens for a hashchange
      b. checks the localstorage for a jwt signature
         that indicates whether a user is already logged in or not.
      c. User then checks if the token is true. If the token is true
         then the decodeToken function is called which was imported from
         ./lib/decode-token
         A. DecodeToken takes one parameter and deconstructs the second index
            of token that split the string with '.' as an argument
         B. The atob method is called to decode the base64 encoded encodedPayload variable
            and is assigned as a JSON string to the const variable jsonPayload
         C. The JSON.parse is called with 1 argument jsonPayload and the return value
            is then assigned to the constant variable payload.
         D. The variable payload is then returneed from the decodedToken function
            bring us back to the app.jsx
      d. If the token is false null is assigned to the constant variable user
      e. The setState method of the this object is called with one argument an
         object literal with two properties the key user and value of the const variable
         user and the key isAuthorizing with the value of false
